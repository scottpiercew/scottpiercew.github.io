# Description

This freelance project was built to provide The Quad Co with a landing page to tell users about their launch. Behind the user sign-in, fitness companies can advertise last minute discounted seats in their gyms.

You can check out the site here: [The Quad Co](https://fitness-finder.herokuapp.com/).
